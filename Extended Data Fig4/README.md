# Plotting ShinyHaplotypes comparisons

The ExtDataFig4.R code reads the ShinyHaplotypes output directory and plots haplotype comparisons for a selected reference strain

*#* Reference strain

Currently code is set to load plots for B71

*#* Comparator strains

Currently code is set to compare against all non-PoT/PoL1 strains

*#*  Clade colors

Color scheme is set all non-donors as black and all PoX-related populations as blue.
