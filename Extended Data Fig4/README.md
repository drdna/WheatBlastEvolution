# Plotting ShinyHaplotypes comparisons

The ExtDataFig4.R code reads the ShinyHaplotypes output directory (NEE_SHINY) and plots haplotype comparisons for a selected reference strain. Code blocks that can be edited for different plotting behavior are:

### *#* Reference strain

Currently set to load plots for B71

### *#* Comparator strains

Code is currently set to compare against all non-PoT/PoL1 strains

### *#*  Clade colors

Color scheme is set all non-donors as black and all PoX-related populations as blue
